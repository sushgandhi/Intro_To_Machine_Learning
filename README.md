# Intro to Machine Learning

This Repo contains the Notes from Prof. Andrew Ng's  Machine Learning Course.

All the course assignments are done using Python 2.7

Apart from the main course materail and assignments. This repo combines the main points from the amazing book "Data Science from Scratch".

And from Udacity's "Intro to Machine Learning" Course.

Idea is that this repo can be considered as consolidated resource for getting started with machine learning. 
Both Theoretical knowledge of Statistics and Machine Learning Algorithms And Practical knowledge on how to implement this using just python to get complete understanding.

In most cases I have also included the starter code on how to implement using most popular Python Libraries - Pandas, NumPy, SkLearn.

The basic assumption is that reader has knowledge about Basic Python libraries along wih exposure to plotting, pandas, numpu.
